            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Where the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Goſpel comes in power, it doth not onely conquer and caſt downe theſe thoughts which riſe up againſt the Lord Chriſt, but alſo captivates and conformes every thought to the Lawes of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This expreſſion <hi>(leading captive)</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports three things. 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>2. A holding them under a continued captivity, that they never break looſe, and get power again in us: Mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thoughts neither are, nor can be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the law of God, they will always be riſing, though under chains.</p>
                  <p>3. A putting in a new power into the mind, wherby our thoughts are, ſtrongly ſweetly &amp; freely brought into ſubjection to Chriſt. Our natural corrupt thoughts are the Captives, our new ſpirituall thoughts are the free ſubjects of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Heere are three eminent degrees
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:130756:10"/>
whereby the Miniſtry of the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and works upon the thoughts, in bringing in ſinners to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>The Miniſtery of the Goſpel is here compared to a <hi>warfare,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Tim.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The life of every Chriſtian is a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warfare: but Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are more eminently <hi>men of war,</hi> not only in reſpect of their Saintſhip, but chiefly in relation to their Miniſteriall ſervice: they fight not onely againſt Principalities and Powers of darkneſs, but principally againſt that principality and power which theſe have in mens ſouls. The Divels will draw up all their ſtrength to diſturb thoſe who would diſthrone them to pull down that office which is erected for the pulling downe of their ſtrong holds.</p>

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:130756:11"/>
2. They war againſt mens luſts, which are as near and dear to the ſinner as his <hi>right hand</hi> and <hi>right eye,</hi> yea as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, yea, as his own ſoule; the worke of the Miniſtery cannot be done but by <hi>warring:</hi> the word ſpoken in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery is the ſweeteſt <hi>peace,</hi> but the work performed therein is the ſharpeſt <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the words of the Text we have theſe three things mainly obſervable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is an evident expreſſion and deſcription of ſinners, as they ſtand in their old eſtate, by the depravation, diſobedience, and defilement of their thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The firſt and grand evils that are caſt out and cured by the word of Truth comming with power upon mens ſoules are evill exorbitant thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The power of Renewing grace that comes into the ſoule by the preaching of the Goſpel doth primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally manifeſt it ſelfe in caſting down, changing, crucifying, and captivating mens thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and great work of the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> in the converſion of ſinners by the Miniſtery of the Goſpel is upon their thoughts. Here are four expreſſions in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:130756:11"/>
the text that doe mainly and primarily hold forth the thoughts: theſe <hi>ſtrong holds</hi> and <hi>heights</hi> are chiefly in mens thoughts. If once the thoughts be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ſanctified, and ſet in frame, the affections, and all the actings of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible converſation will be in a holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly order of obedience.</p>
                  <p>In handling this doctrine of the <hi>thoughts,</hi> there are three <hi>myſteries</hi> which I will endeavour to open. 1. The <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> which worketh in mans thoughts before renewing. 2. The <hi>myſtery</hi> of <hi>ſanctity,</hi> which acteth in mans thoughts after the renewing of the heart: both theſe are held forth in this Text.</p>
                  <p>3. The myſtery of <hi>Satanicall injected</hi> thoughts wherewith the Saints are much <hi>buffeted:</hi> theſe black blaſphemous thoughts are as ſo many Darts which Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> caſteth into the holieſt hearts: many precious ſoules walke ſadly and ſorrowfully, not being acquainted with the riſe of theſe wicked thoughts, and the grounds of ſupport that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcovers.</p>
                  <p>For the clearer underſtanding of thoughts in their myſterious qualities we muſt firſt know what <hi>thoughts</hi> are in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130756:12"/>
their proper entity and being.</p>

men, and prefixed a certaine tearm of years, wherein he would wait for their repentance: he had alſo predicted the time of their exciſion, except they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; but theſe Gigantive fighters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God are ſo far from repenting for ſins paſt, that they go on dayly to <hi>fill up the meaſure of their ſins.</hi> Therefore at length God prepares to take revenge upon theſe Rebels: this is the ſum and ſcope of theſe words.</p>

1. Carnall men conceive there is no all-preſent Being, they think that God is confined to a certain place, ſhut up in Heaven, and not preſent in all places: Thus by denying the Omni-preſence of God, the mind of man imagines God to be ſuch a one as he is not, and ſo turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him into an Idol.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="2">2. Carnall men conceive there is no <hi>all-ruling providence</hi> of God, whereby he obſerveth and ordereth all things in

                  <p>2. Poor Souls at their firſt looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt, are apt to limit the power of God, and to think thus in their hearts if our ſins were of a lighter and lower nature, we could then conceive they might be pardoned: but can God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuch black bloody ſins, crying capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Crimes, prevarications and procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations as we are guilty of?

                  </p>
                  <p>By this limiting the power of God in our thoughts, we conceive him like to our ſelves in a finite perfection, and therby we turn him into an Idol of our own fancy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Ungodly ones conceive God to be <hi>all mercy,</hi> and <hi>no juſtice:</hi> They think to find life in the way of death; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in a courſe of ſinning, and yet they imagine that <hi>no evill can come unto</hi>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:130756:56"/>
unto God: There are certain acts of mercy in man that cannot be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God; mercy as tis in man hath theſe three eminent internall acts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is <hi>Condolency,</hi> when a man hath an inward ſenſe of anothers miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and is afflicted in the ſenſe therof, this is call'd <hi>Compaſſion.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Condolency</hi> cannot be in God, for where there is no <hi>pasſion</hi> there can be no <hi>compasſion</hi> properly<hi>:</hi> this affection is inconſiſtent with men, glorified in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God is able to help whom ſoever he will; mercy is in men with delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not ſo in God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third act of mercy is an <hi>abſolute will, of releiving</hi> the miſerable, and this is granted to be in God<hi>:</hi> we do highly diſhonour God, and make him an Idol, if we conceive any affection or virtue to be in God as it is in the Creatures.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The third <hi>evil thought,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds out of the heart of men, is a <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming thought:</hi> now the blaſpemies which run through mans corrupt mind, are exceeding many and monſtrous; but there are four ſpecial thoughts of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, which do poſſeſſe the hearts of carnal men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:130756:74"/>
conceive to be moſt fooliſh. Natural men have vile thoughts of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al myſteries of the Goſpel, as that the eternal God ſhould become man in time; that Chriſt by death ſhould free men from death, &amp; by his poverty make them rich that men muſt accuſe, abhor and condemn themſelves, and look for all life, righteouſneſſe and acceptance from Chriſt; that they muſt be <hi>nothing</hi> in themſelves, and all in another: that when they are <hi>weak</hi> in themſelves, then they are <hi>ſtrong:</hi> that men ſhould be as having <hi>nothing,</hi> and yet poſſeſſe <hi>all things,</hi> that they muſt be <hi>fools,</hi> that they may be <hi>wiſe,</hi> that men of years muſt be <hi>born again,</hi> &amp;c. carnal men conceive <note place="margin">John 3 4.</note> theſe to be fooliſh notions, yea <hi>they are fooliſhneſſe unto them, Cor.</hi> 2: 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond blaſpemous thought which poſſeſſeth corrupt minds, is this, that <hi>the law</hi> of God is <hi>falſhood,</hi> the truths of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which do contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their carnal reaſon, men conceive to be <hi>fooliſhneſſe</hi> and the threat of the <hi>Law</hi> that do croſſe and curſe their corrupt affections they imagine to be <hi>untruths,</hi> words that ſhall never take hold upon them<hi>:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3.

It is impoſſible for contrite Converts to act this ſpeculative wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe ordinarily, though they may be overtaken through infirmity; they are filled with bitter ſorrowful thoughts, ſighs and ſhame, in the review of their old ſinfull pleaſures and vanities, as is evident in the repenting <hi>Romans,</hi> who were now aſhamed of their former fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. ſo when <hi>Ephraim</hi> thought of his ſinne, <hi>he was aſhamed and repented.</hi>

                  <p>This is the practiſe of meer civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and formaliſts, who make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be holy in their thoughts, but onely they take care with the harlot <hi>to wipe the lips,</hi> with <hi>Pilate to waſh the hands,</hi> and with the <hi>Phariſees to cleanſe the outſide,</hi> as for their thoughts, they ſuffer them to run riot, to have their full

                  <p n="2">2. This falſe opinion of thought-free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, draws men to place Religion in outward ſervices, and <hi>bodily exerciſes,</hi> without giving to God a thought-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip<hi>:</hi> hence it is, that they reſt in the <hi>work done</hi> without the concurrence of the heart and thoughts; they <hi>draw near to God with their lips,</hi> and bring the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, when their Thoughts are far from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29. 16. their chiefeſt care is to appear to men, and to be appproved by men, and not by God who ſeeth and ſearcheth the heart, and ſo they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh in bodily ſervice and outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of lip-labour and loſt labour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When men upon this conceit, that thoughts are free, do give up the rains to their own Imaginations, and take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in vain vile and prophane thoughts, it is juſt with God to give them up to <hi>vile affections,</hi> abominable actings, and a <hi>Reprobate ſenſe:</hi> ſo that as they caſt off the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt in their thoughts, and will not have him to <hi>rule</hi> in their hearts, ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> gives up them to walk as <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> as men <hi>without yoke,</hi> after the <hi>vanity of their minds,</hi> and luſts of their own

                  <p>This is moſt evident in the men of the old world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 1. 2, 5. they profeſſed themſelves <hi>ſonnes of God,</hi> and joyned themſelves to the viſible Church, yet being poſſeſt with this curſed conceit of thought-freedome, they lodged evill thoughts in their hearts continually, till at length they were given up to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen committing of all manner of ſinne with greedineſſe and great delight, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Flood came and ſwept them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together into Hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. 20.</p>

And this is the caſe of divers Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in this preſent licentious world, who are fallen into error of judgement and practiſes, if they would ſeriouſly ſearch and ſurvey their own hearts, they ſhould find that looſeneſſe of thoughts is the chief cauſe of their giving up to looſeneſſe in opinion and converſation.</p>
                  <p>This corrupt conceit of liberty of thoughts in the tendency there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, opens a gappe to all wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe; and makes way for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable obcecation and obduration of heart, for men being once poſſeſſed with this peſtilent perſwaſion, they now take their fill of all inward filth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inviſible to man, and in the end they let looſe the bridle to all external wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: becauſe this being preſuppoſed that thoughts are free, it will eaſily be inferred, that works are free alſo: if men take liberty of conſcience to think any thing, they will in time pretend li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience to act any thing.</p>

5. This pernicious Principle of thought-freedome doth aboliſh and take away all internall piety, heart-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and thought-worſhip; and ſo turns all piety and divine worſhip into a meer outward form of Phariſaiſme, and a dead carcaſſe of devotion, whereby men rob God of his chiefeſt ſervice.</p>

                     <hi>Quere,</hi> What is the true ground and root of this Atheiſticall conceit, that thoughts are free?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Speculative vanity and uncleanneſſe is ſuitable and ſweet to carnall hearts, they love to ſolace and ſport themſelves in the thoughts of their ſenſual pleaſures, riches, and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-contentments: hereupon men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come to this concluſion that <hi>thoughts are free,</hi> becauſe themſelves ſo willingly give way to their own Thoughts<hi>:</hi> we are very apt to cloſe with any Principle which tends to the allowance of thoſe actings that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>2. Carnal men and women are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Gods Law in the ſpirituality and latitude thereof<hi>:</hi> they meaſure and judge of the compaſſe of the Commandements by the outward letter onely, fancying to themſelves a
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:130756:125"/>
Law which reacheth onely to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as did the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> from theſe falſe premiſes thy conclude liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoughts.</p>
                  <p>3. They diſcern not the ſpirituality of Religion and repentance, which is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily and principally acted in the heart and thoughts.</p>
                  <p>4<hi>:</hi> The ungoſpel general way of preaching of divers men, tends very much to the ſettling and fixing of this peſtilent opinion in carnall hearts, that thoughts are free:</p>
                  <p>For 1. Some there be who ſtrive to pleaſe the <hi>itching ears</hi> and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their hearers, with notionall Doctrines, and empty enticing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
                  <p>2. Others crying <hi>peace, peace,</hi> do altogether publiſh the pardons of free grace, but they never preſſe the power of renewing grace upon the heart and thoughts of men: whereas the aim and principal work of Goſpel-preaching is, to <hi>caſt down the imaginations and heights</hi> of mans heart, and to <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate every thought to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle clearly ſhows, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4, 5. all our Declarations of Gods grace and mercy, muſt tend firſt
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:130756:125"/>
and chiefly to the ſubduing and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the thoughts of mens hearts.</p>
                  <p>3. A third ſort of Teachers make it their whole work to cry down viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exorbitances and ſcandalous ſinnes; and to perſwade to external duties of Religion and a moral converſation; this was the way of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> preaching.</p>
                  <p>4. Some ſoar aloft in Seraphical no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, high ſpeculations, and ſtrange expreſſions which ſerve onely to feed the fancy, and to fill mens heads with whimſies.</p>
                  <p>So that the heart and thoughts of men being altogether neglected by a great number of Teachers, and the wickednes of mans natural imaginations, not being faithfully and effectually laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; What wonder is it, if men do flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves with a groundleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the goodneſſe of their heart, and ſo give credit to this deluding Principle, that <hi>thoughts are free:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe preachers do not ſtrike at their thoughts, nor diſcover any danger in them.</p>

                     <hi>Query</hi> 2. How doth it appear from Scripture that thoughts are not free.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>In theſe words the Apoſtle proveth the being of this naturall Law by two effects flowing from thence, even in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their doing of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and commanded in the <hi>law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <note place="margin">Rom 2. v. 15.</note>

                  <p>Theſe fruits do plainly demonſtrate, that there <hi>is</hi> a law of <hi>nature,</hi> and a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge of this Law bubling up in mans nature: the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who knew nothing of the letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, yet they carry the <hi>work of the Law written in their hearts,</hi> that is a Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the morall Law.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve here 1. The Gentiles had not the written Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and yet <hi>they did the things preſcribed</hi> and <hi>contained</hi> in the written <hi>Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies.</p>
                  <p>Here is their practiſe, and the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their practiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Divers things preſcribed in the Law, they knew and practiſed: ſome worſhip they performed unto God.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> At their coming into this world; as is evident, John 1. 9. <hi>Chriſt is the true light that lightens every man that cometh into the world:</hi> that is, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man who is born into this world.</p>
                  <p>This cannot be be meant of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual light of grace, <hi>that light of life,</hi> that hath eternal life in it, <hi>John</hi> 17 3. for the elect onely receive that new light at their new birth, that is a light <hi>from the Lord,</hi> and <hi>in the Lord, Epheſ.</hi> 5. flowing from their union with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Text, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9. ſpeaks of the light of nature, which is a common benefit that men receive by and from <hi>Chriſt:</hi> thus <hi>Cyril</hi> took this light for the <hi>light of nature</hi> and <hi>natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>univerſal Enunciati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and ſo do many of our Reformers following him: it is univerſally and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily of true the light of <hi>nature</hi> which is in infants radically.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> lightens every man, Jew and Gentile, without reſpect of perſons, with <hi>natural light</hi> which ſhines upon both with an impartial beam.</p>

from thence, was the peculiar pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge <note place="margin">Rom 9.</note> of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That by means of thoſe beams of of heavenly truth that ſhined more peculiarly upon them, the Jewes had even thoſe natural notions much clarified and refined from thoſe clouds and miſts which mans originall corruption caſts upon them: but yet they have no greater portion of the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> than all men have<hi>:</hi> ſo that <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Grecian, Barbarian, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian, bond and free men,</hi> all theſe are <hi>one,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>natures Law, and natures light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things, wherein Jews and Gentiles are <hi>one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the <hi>darkneſſe of</hi> corrupted <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Rom. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>natural</hi> principles, <hi>John</hi> 1. 9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are <hi>one,</hi> ſo farre as they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of <hi>a new nature</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>3. It is evident that this <hi>natural light,</hi> is a common gift that every man recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, by and for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though none but believers have eternal life and ſalvation by him, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
                  <p>3. The third thing to be demonſtrated, is this, that evil thoughts are directly <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:130756:137"/>
                     <hi>the Law of nature,</hi> they are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of that naturall Law that is written in every mans heart: this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt clearly.</p>
                  <p>1. In the men of the <hi>old world,</hi> the great ſinne which is laid to their charge, and that chiefly for which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, was, their evil thoughts, as you may read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. 6. 7. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>The thoughts of their hearts were evil continually from their childhood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quer.</p>
                  <p>But what Law of God did theſe men violate in their thoughts? What Law was there then that did forbid and condemne evil thoughts, every ſinne is a tranſgreſſion of ſome divine Law: by what Law did they periſh? there was no poſitive written Law in the dayes of the old world, the written <hi>Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by</hi> Moſes many ages after the flood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that Law which thoſe <hi>giants</hi> of the old world did tranſgreſſe in their thoughts, was the <hi>Law of nature</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in their hearts<hi>:</hi> there was no Law then in being, but what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in mens nature, there was no divine <hi>Scripture</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> but that which was written in every mans heart by the finger of God, ſo that the firſt Law that was broken by mans thoughts,

was <hi>natures</hi> Law, therefore evil thoughts are tranſgreſſions of the Law of <hi>nature,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It appears as clearly in the <hi>ſinners of the Gentiles: vanity of thoughts</hi> is the Capitall crime for which they are indicted and condemned by the heart-ſearcher, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>This I ſay, and teſtifie in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind: this vanity of mind</hi> in which the <hi>Heathens walk</hi> is the vanity of their Thoughts, and thus the Syriack verſion reads it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Infidel Gentiles were full of vain ungodly thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In their worſhipping of God they turned the true God into an image of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:130756:139"/>
their own fancy, conceiving God to be like to the creatures, verſe 23.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were full of vile, unclean, fooliſh, filthy thoughts in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon converſation.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it is manifeſt that <hi>vain thoughts</hi> were the radical leading ſin in the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what Law of God did they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in their thoughts? it is evident by the Scriptures, that the <hi>Infidel Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> knew nothing of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law in the letter of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. 20. <hi>He he hath declared his words to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his</hi>

                  <p>Rom. 2. 12. 14. it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>the Gentiles have not the law,</hi> that is, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but they had a Law written in their hearts, and this is that Law which they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, now when the Apoſtle would demonſtrate that the Gentiles ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> he mentions their <hi>vain thoughts,</hi> as their grand ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21.</p>

So then 'tis moſt apparant that vain thoughts are tranſgreſſions and viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Common-Law of <hi>nature,</hi> therefore <hi>thoughts are not free.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly evil thoughts are expreſly condemned by the <hi>Royall</hi> Law of <hi>love,</hi> publiſhed in the holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>1. The written <hi>law is ſpirituall,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the inward thoughts of men intending a heart ſervice and ſanctity, and binding every thought and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obedience, as is moſt evident by the expoſition of the great Law-giver himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. and by the certain knowledge and experience of all his people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 14. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh in the perſon of all regenerate men, <hi>we know that the law is ſpirituall,</hi> requiring a ſpirituall, angelical obedience, a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the will of God with our ſpirits and internall thoughts, as it is done by thoſe angelical ſpirits in heaven.</p>
                  <p>It is the glory and excellency of Gods Law to be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> reaching to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt thoughts and imaginations, and binding the whole inward and outward man with all its actings.</p>
                  <p>The Law is <hi>ſpirituall</hi> in its nature, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and end.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It layes bonds upon the internall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:130756:140"/>
thoughts of men, as well as upon their externall works: it gives <hi>rules</hi> to the heart, and over-rules the thoughts, which no earthly powers can do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The holy Law forbids and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth all evil thoughts ariſing in and out of mans heart, in all the kinds and degrees thereof.</p>
                  <p>The motions of ſinfull corruption in mans mind, or thinking faculty are of two ſorts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt motions or the ſecond motions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The first</hi> vitious motions are thoſe ſtirrings of corruption in men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their minds are firſt inſtigated and moved to think evil, but theſe have not deliberate conſent of their wills, theſe the School-men call <hi>Concupiſcence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Now both theſe are condemned by the Royall Law, it forbids the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of ſinne in the thoughts of men coming <hi>from within,</hi> from their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption, though never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:130756:140"/>
or allowed by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Evil thoughts againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, are either thoughts with conſent or without conſent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>There be two ſpecial ſinnes which are directly forbidden in the <hi>tenth</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Commandements doe forbid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the outward Act, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deſire of another mans goods to his hurt or dammage: for as deſire after another mans wife is <hi>adultery, Matth.</hi> 5 28. ſo the deſire of any others houſe or beaſt wrongfully is <hi>ſtealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>tenth</hi> precept condemnes the <hi>firſt motions</hi> of concupiſcence ariſing in and from our hearts, though not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to, &amp; it is purpoſely ſet in the laſt place, as conducing to the expoſit on of the former precepts, which do condemn the outward facts and inward motions of Concupiſcence riſing <hi>with conſent,</hi> whereby they are really diſtinct from the laſt Commandement, which muſt forbid ſomething not directly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the other Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, evil thoughts are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Evangelical <hi>law of grace</hi> and <hi>faith;</hi> as may evidently appear by theſe ſeven arguments.</p>

                  <p>The thinking of evil is here joyned with ſelf exalting, which is the greateſt folly and fighting againſt God when we have <hi>thought evil,</hi> we muſt lay our <hi>hands</hi> upon our <hi>mouths,</hi> that is, our hearts muſt be filled with ſorrow and ſhame for the ſame, from a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of our guiltineſſe.</p>

                  <p>Now there is great reaſon and cauſe why we ſhould be deeply humbled for our thought-ſinnes.</p>

Goſpel promiſe: it was mercy to give us the firſt promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 'tis mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to give us any promiſe: 'tis mercy to continue promiſes after ſo many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures and failings on our part.</p>

                     <p n="3">3. Gods <hi>thoughts</hi> of mercy to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinners are as far above their higheſt thoughts and apprehenſions that they have of Gods mercy, as the heavens are above the earth, this is evident by the teſtimony of the God of mercy, <hi>Iſa.</hi>

55. 8, 9. <hi>as the heavens are higher than the earth, ſo are my wayes higher than yur wayes, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.</hi> It is ſpoken of Gods thoughts and wayes of pardoning mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to returning ſinners, as is apparant by verſe 7. there <hi>Jehovah</hi> promiſeth to <hi>ſhow mercy and to multiply pardons,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the multitudes of their thoughts and evil wayes.</p>
                     <p>Now there be two grand objections that ſome ſorrowfull ſouls are apt to make againſt their cloſing with mercy offered.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Their Thoughts have ſuch an heighth of malignity and ſinfulneſſe by reaſon of their horrid nature, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe ſwarms that they cannot think how God ſhould pardon them.</p>
                     <p n="3">2. That their wayes have been ſo highly injurious and offenſive to God, that if any man ſhould do but the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand part of that treſpaſſe to them that they have done againſt God, they could not forgive them: how hard is it for us to paſſe by ſmall injuries? <hi>&amp;c-</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To both theſe objections, God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers my thoughts of pardoning mercy, (ſaith he) are as far above all your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions thereof, and my wayes of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:130756:153"/>
mercy are as far above all your wayes of forgiveneſſe to men, as the heavens are above the earth.</p>
                     <p>When ye think thus with your ſelves we could not poſſibly forgive any man, in caſe of ſo great wrong, and ye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive any reaſon why I ſhould forgive you; yet know that my thoughts and wayes of mercy, are as infinitely above all yours as the heaven is above the earth.</p>
                     <p>Men are revengefull in their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and will not forgive, but <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> is a God of mercies, <hi>and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give;</hi> he hath the mercies and power of a God, an infinite, incomprehenſible mercy and power, and therefore he can pardon where men cannot, yea beyond what they can poſſibly think and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 1. The heart of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inlarged and raiſed by divine grace is able to think of high and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mercies, yet when the moſt inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hearts have gone as high as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a created heart to riſe in concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Gods mercies; yet even then Gods thoughts of mercy to Repentants, are infinitely above and beyond their largeſthoughts.</p>
                     <p>It is very obſervable that God ſayes
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:130756:154"/>
not that his wayes and thoughts of knowledge and wiſdome, but his wayes and thoughts of mercy are as far above mans, as the <hi>heavens are above the earth,</hi> indeed as God is above men which is infinitely.</p>
                     <p>The great God argues from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe heighth of his mercy, purpoſely to heighten and ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="4">4. The mercies of God have a <hi>heighth</hi> above all that is, or can be <hi>written</hi> of them, exceeding high and glorious things are ſpoken of Gods mercies in the holy Scriptures, but the heighth thereof is above all that tongue or pen can poſſibly expreſſe: as there are <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes written and not written</hi> for diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſinners, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. that is, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and miſeries prepared for wicked men, are farre greater than are written in the Scriptures, ſo there be <hi>mercies</hi> written and not written: the Scriptures cannot hold and contain all that mercy

Thoughts are ſpring actions, and ſtreams, as our thoughts are, ſo are the actings of our affections, ſo are our prayers and all our performances: therefore it concerns us above all keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep our thoughts.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly conſider that mans heart of it ſelf is ſufficient to bring forth all kind of evil thoughts, and that without any injection from <hi>Satan,</hi> and inſtigation from outward objects, the Devil may caſt in any thought into our heart, but all the powers of darkneſſe cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten the guilt and ſpot of any one ſinne upon our thoughts without our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and cloſing with the ſuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but the corrupt heart of men hath a ſufficiency to beget and conceive any wicked, blaſphemous thoughts, and to corrupt the whole man with all kind of ſinfull thoughts and works, as having in it ſelf the ground and ſpawn thereof,</p>

                     <p>Earthly powers take upon them to govern our tongues, hands and viſible actings, but God onely challengeth a power and principality over our thoughts: therefore by turning Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines in our thoughts, we turn God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Idol of our own fancy, denying his Soveraign dominion over our thoughrs and knowledge of them, and ſo we rob him of his chiefeſt Royalty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The obſerving ordering and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our thoughts within due bounds, is the glory and ſtrictneſſe, difficulty and ſingularity of the true <hi>Religion</hi> above all others in the world.

                     <p>That which makes the practiſe of Chriſtianity ſo full of difficulty is the well ordering of our thoughts, this is true godlineſſe to keep our thoughts in a holy, heavenly frame, without this all Religion is but <hi>bodily exerciſe</hi> a meer form and a <hi>name to live.</hi>

                     <hi>Sanctity</hi> that worketh in the thoughts of all thoſe who are truly Sanctified.</p>
                  <p>In this Text, this is cheifly obſervea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; That the power of ſanctifying Grace, which comes into the ſoule by the preaching of the Goſpel, doth firſt and principally ſhow it ſelfe in caſting down, changing, crucifying, and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating mens thoughts: The firſt and great work of the <hi>ſpirit of Grace</hi> in the converſion of ſinners is upon their <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Firſt, That there is no ſelf-ſufficiency in mans <hi>corrupt minde</hi> to think one holy ſpiritual thought; this the Scripture clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſeth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.

                     <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. We are by corrupt nature all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fleſh, we have rotten corrupt <hi>minds</hi> full of fleſhly principles, full of pride and contradiction againſt the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 5. Epheſ. 4. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Truth</hi> that is <hi>in Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have fleſhly wills and affections; ſinfull corruption is as a <hi>chaine</hi> upon all our faculties, as an <hi>iron gate</hi> that keeps out any good thought, or corrupteth it when it comes in.</p>

If the bent and reliſh of our wills and affections be not changed, they will ſet our imagination on work to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſatisfaction to themſelves; for there is a mutuall reflux and working betwixt the imagination and affections. Mans imagination ſtirs up his affections, and as the bent of the affections ſtands, ſo imagination worketh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in our new birth there is healing, quickning, renewing Grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into our ſoules, whereby we are freely inclined to ſpirituall good thoughts and works.</p>
                  <p>This infuſed implanted <hi>Grace</hi> is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Scriptures, the <hi>life of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt living in us;</hi> the <hi>image of</hi>

The <hi>new creature: a new heart and ſpirit,</hi> a new frame of heart and ſpirit put into us; it is the implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of holy principles, inclinations, and diſpoſitions, whereby our natures are made conformable to the ſweet pure holy nature of Chriſt, and agreeable to all divine rules in ſome meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this <hi>regenerating Grace,</hi> or new divine <hi>life</hi> put into our ſoules, is the immediate principle of all our holy
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:130756:171"/>
thoughts and workes. Actions come from powers, and are ſuitable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; holy ſpirituall Acts cannot come from unſanctified powers and faculties; living thoughts cannot proceed out of dead mindes.</p>
                  <p>In mans <hi>naturall</hi> life, there is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſoule,</hi> which is the principle of life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Life it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Acts of life: Theſe three are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable.</p>
                  <p>So in the <hi>ſpirituall</hi> life, there is</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>quickning ſpirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The vitall <hi>being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Living <hi>Acts:</hi> and theſe are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. This new life is an active power, whereby the ſoule is inabled to Act and move towards God.</p>
                  <p>All our holy thoughts and works are the fruits and actings of this divine life in us: there muſt be a power and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holineſs put into mans heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can think holy thoughts: every thing acteth according to its being: <hi>an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> Carnall mindes cannot thing ſpirituall thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being premiſed I now come to the Doctrine it ſelfe; in the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:130756:172"/>
opening whereof, I muſt</p>
                  <p>Firſt, demonſtrate that renewing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace doth primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally put forth it ſelfe upon mans thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will declare what are the powerfull, precious, operations of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace upon the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that ſanctifying Grace, after the change of the frame of our hearts, doth firſt and chiefly worke upon our thoughts; I thus demonſtrate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Evill thoughts are the radicall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall ſinnes which corrupt our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, affections, and all our actions; therfore it is neceſſary that our thoughts ſhould be firſt cleanſed cured and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Grace.</p>
                  <p>Sinne entred into our firſt parents by their thoughts; crooked thoughts were the root of their curſed apoſtacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All our actuall ſinns have their beginning and riſe in our thoughts: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill thoughts are the <hi>begetters</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes, the firſt <hi>movers</hi> and <hi>leaders</hi> in all evill, the <hi>plotters</hi> of all iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and man; Till theſe radical evills be rooted up, our words and works will be the fruits of ſin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the crucifying of the habituall
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:130756:172"/>
corruption of mens nature, the principal work of Grace is to mortifie and purifie their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the firſt Act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and mortification preſſed upon ſinners, is to <hi>waſh their hearts from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe;</hi> that is, <hi>from vaine thoughts</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>which lodge within them:</hi> True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance begins whence ſin begins; that is, in the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>ſtrong hold</hi> whereby the Devill holds poſſeſſion of mens ſoules, is chiefly in their thoughts; Till the thoughts be caſt down and changed by converting Grace, the Devil cannot <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4, 5.</note> be caſtout.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all <hi>actuall holineſſe</hi> begins in the thoughts; habituall holineſſe is properly in the new frame of our hearts; actual holineſſe is that which is acted in our affections and converſations: holy works and words have their riſe from holy thoughts: as the ſpirits are in the body, ſo are thoughts in the ſoule, they run through all, move all, and Act all in us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the new ſpirituall <hi>minde</hi> is put for the whole <hi>new man,</hi> for all that is regenerate in us, in our mindes, wills, affections, and all the powers of

                     <hi>renewing of your minde.</hi> That great <hi>metamorphoſis,</hi> or transforming change, which is wrought by the new birth, hath its firſt beginning in our mindes; for if we are transformed by the <hi>renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our minde;</hi> then it muſt needs follow, that the minde is firſt renewed; and by the change of the frame of the minde and thoughts, the whole man is changed, and all things made new in us.</p>
                  <p>2. Holy thoughts, which are the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the renewed minde, doe act and command our judgements, affections, eyes, tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a holy heavenly order.

                  <p>Secondly, I will now ſhow you what are the powerful and precious <hi>operations</hi> and workings of ſanctifying Grace upon mans thoughts; whereby we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerne whether we are truly poſſeſt of the glorious ſtate of Grace: And I beſeech you marke this ſearching truth, for a holy gracious frame of thoughts doth far more clearly and infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the power of ſanctification from the ſtate of formallity and higheſt temporary perfections, then words and works, and all outwardneſs of carriage, though never ſo glorious in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for in theſe (many times) is much fraud and fallacie, forced feigned behaviours, artificiall and counterfeit acting, and hidden hypocriſies.

If we would take certain knowledge of our ſelves, whether we are good or evill men, ſanctified or unſanctified, we muſt looke into the frame of our thoughts. Every man is compared to a <hi>Tree,</hi> our thoughts are the moſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing fruits whereby we may diſcern what manner of Trees we are. The onely way for other men to know what kind of Trees we are, is by our viſible fruits, externall works and ſpeeches: But if we our ſelves would judge of our ſelves, we muſt try our ſelves firſt and chiefly by our internall thoughts. The ſureſt and moſt infallible way to judge of our ſpirituall eſtate, is by the conſtant acting of our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>2 Thoughts and imaginations doe ordinarily follow the frame and temper of the heart wherein they are formed, and ſo they are the trueſt diſcovery of the nature and conſtitution of the heart: As ſtreams doe reſemble and expreſſe the quality and property of thoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines whence they ſpring. We may truly judge of the frame and fabrick of our hearts, by the ordinary working of our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>But now we are not to take meaſure of our thoughts by ſome particular ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:130756:175"/>
and extraordinary motions we ſometimes feele in them; but according to the common current and generall actings of our thoughts; For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times evill men may have good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and workings in their thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which is good; but good thoughts in carnall men doe glide and paſſe away preſently without any fruit to their owne ſoules.</p>
                  <p>So on the other ſide, good men may ſometimes be over-powred and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by evill thoughts, either by the ſudden breaking out of remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from within, or by violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of ſome entiſing object from without; or by the impetuous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate injections of <hi>Satan:</hi> But ſuch thoughts as theſe are contrary to the generall and ſetled purpoſe of their hearts.</p>
                  <p>2 The <hi>New man</hi> in them doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and reſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>3 The Saints know how to repent of them, and pray againſt them.</p>
                  <p>4 They walk more humbly, and ſet a ſtrong guard and more narrow watch over their hearts for afterwards, leaſt they ſhould be unawares ſurprized the ſecond time.</p>

                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:130756:176"/>
Thirdly, The whole converſation followes the frame and temper of the thoughts: Such as a mans heart is, ſuch are his thoughts ordinarily; and ſuch as his thoughts are, ſuch is the frame of his converſation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. <hi>As a man tbinketh in his heart, ſo is he.</hi> The thoughts of men are the ſpring from whence iſſues a good or bad converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are the maſter-wheele which acteth &amp; turnes about the whole courſe <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> and carriage of their lives; they have a ſtrong influence upon all their wayes.</p>
                  <p>The ſweetning of this <hi>ſpring</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the whole converſation: If wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be corrupt, the fountaine muſt firſt be cleanſed and ſweetned, and then the ſtreames will be ſweet. The Prophet <hi>healed the waters by caſting ſalt into the ſpring,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 20. If our thoughts be full of holineſſe, they will overflow into our affections, and actions, and fill our ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>What are the powerfull operations <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> of Sanctifying Grace upon mans thoughts?</p>
                  <p>They are theſe eſpecially.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It <hi>Diſcovers</hi> a world of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> in mens thoughts, which they never ſaw before. Renewing grace ſets
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:130756:176"/>
up a new light in the mind, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts the Atheiſme, Idolatry, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Unrighteouſneſſe, Vanity, Pride, and Profaneneſſe of their thoughts. Carnall men may ſee the groſſe irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, and open defilements of their works and ſpeeches; but they ſee not the firſt riſe of corruption in their thoughts. Sinners are poſſeſt with this peſtilent conceit, that thoughts are free: but when the word of God falls with converting power upon their ſoules, <hi>the ſecret thoughts of their hearts are made manifeſt</hi> in their naturall filth and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.</note> folly, ſo that now they begin to ſee that the ſins of their thoughts are out of meaſure ſinfull and innumerable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sanctifying Grace <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes</hi> the vanity and vileneſſe of mens thoughts; it drawes them to ſentence, and condemn the evil of their thoughts, and themſelves for their evil thoughts. Carnall men doe feed upon the forth of their filthy thoughts with delight, but regenerate men doe with much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſpirit judge themſelves for their thought-tranſgreſſions; yea, many humble ſoules, ſenſible of their ſecret provocations, are more grieved and troubled (ſetting aſide the ill of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:130756:177"/>
and ſcandall, ordinary attendants upon open and viſible miſcartiages) for the rebelliouſneſſe of their thoughts, then the exorbitancy and iniquity of their works: It wounds them to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart that they are not as well able to preſerve their inward thoughts pure and holy towards the all-ſearching eye of God, as their words and viſible acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons plauſible and orderly towards men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sanctifying Grace begets a ſincere and deadly <hi>Hatred</hi> of all evill thoughts. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 113. Sayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I hate vaine thoughts.</hi> Renewed perſons doe not onely diſlike evill thoughts, but they alſo hate them, as the grand Enemies of God, they deſire to have them crucified.</p>
                  <p>2 They hate not only thoſe thoughts which are moſt black and bloody, but vaine thoughts alſo; they hate all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and unprofitable thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Renewing Grace <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> the thoughts, and puts them into a holy frame: The naturall frame of mans heart is evill, therefore all that it frameth is altogether evill. A corrupt <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> fountaine cannot ſend forth pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but ſanctifying grace coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans heart, implants a new holy
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:130756:177"/>
principle, which is the ſpring of holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts; it makes the mind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; prepared to every good thought. A ſanctified heart is full of ſanctified thoughts, it is continually exerciſed in godly, uſefull, and profitable medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It can have no reſt but in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall converſes with God. Grace co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from heaven, doth carry up the thoughts into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sanctifying Grace <hi>Purifies</hi> the thoughts, it mortifies that Lording power which ſin exerciſeth in mens thoughts before their renewing. The hearts of all men in their corrupt frame are as a boyling <hi>Sea,</hi> or as a <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of corruption, evapourating and ſending up continually wicked, wanton, and prophane thoughts.</p>
                  <p>How doth grace cleanſe and cure our <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quaere. </seg>
                     </label> thoughts?</p>
                  <p>By a two-fold act.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 By mortifying the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> thoughts, the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or corruption of mans nature, that <hi>root of bitterneſſe</hi> which embitters and corrupts our thoughts continually. Grace <hi>purifies</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15. Mark 7. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>our hearts,</hi> which are the fountaine out of which our thoughts doe flow; this fountain muſt be cleanſed, and ſweetned
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:130756:178"/>
before our thoughts can be clean: Can any clean thing come forth of that which is unclean?</p>
                  <p>That ſinfull corruption which reigns <note place="margin">Job 14. 5.</note> and rages in the hearts of naturall men, muſt be crucified before the ſtrength of ſin can be broken in their thoughts. If carnall men by the power of the word ſhould be ſo affrighted and terrified from the committing of that ſin which they moſt love, that they durſt never actually returne again to it; yet then their naturall corruption would fill their hearts with ſpeculative unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thought-pollutions; their thoughts would ſtill be running after ſin. When the worldly <hi>man dyes, his thoughts periſh;</hi> ſo when <hi>the old man</hi> is mortified in us, evill thoughts dye, in reſpect of their predominant power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Grace purifies our thoughts by filling the mind with the pure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious word of God, which is a powerfull means to keep out and caſt out evill thoughts <hi>I have hid thy word in my heart</hi> (in my thoughts, ſayes <hi>David) that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11. There is a marvellous power in Gods word to drive away and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ungodly thoughts; they can no
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:130756:178"/>
more ſtand before it, then the <hi>Clouds</hi> before a ſtrong <hi>North-wind.</hi> If the <hi>word of Chriſt dwell in our hearts plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,</hi> it is impoſſible that <hi>vain thoughts</hi> ſhould <hi>lodge</hi> there. If our minds be filled with the <hi>word,</hi> there will be no roome for looſe prophane thoughts: When rebellious thoughts doe riſe within us, we ſhall have this <hi>mighty weapon</hi> in readineſſe to reſiſt and repell them.</p>
                  <p>When we feele thoughts of unbelief, pride, diſobedience, earthlineſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begin to ſtir in us, and to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, let us try them by the word of Chriſt, ſee how contrary they are to it, and we ſhall feele them vaniſh away, they will not ſtand to a Tryall. This powerfull word applyed, will ſhame and ſilence them.</p>
                  <p>But here ſome precious ſoules will <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> be ready to object againſt themſelves: If this be the property of ſanctifying grace to purifie the thoughts, Then what ſhall we think of our ſelves? We feele idle, vaine, looſe, earthly, impure, and impertinent thoughts riſing in our hearts continually; they aſſault and break in upon us whatever we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oftentimes they lead us captive:
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:130756:179"/>
Oh therefore how can we conclude that we are truly ſanctified, when we feele ſuch ſwarmes of unſanctified thoughts?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer whereunto, we muſt know, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that there is a two-fold taking away, or mortifying of ſin. Either in its being, or in its dominant prevailing operation.</p>
                  <p>1 Regenerating Grace doth not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally aboliſh ſinfull corruption, ſo that it ceaſeth to be in us, while we be in this world; for ſo long as we have a being in this earthly body, the <hi>body of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>ſin</hi> will have a being in our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>2 But grace mortifies ſin in reſpect of that overpowering prevailing opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it once had in us, while we were under ſin: So that grace doth not ſo take away evill thoughts that they ceaſe to riſe and ſtirre in us; but it caſts them downe from their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power and prevalency, they doe not work with that impetus ſtrength and efficacy as formerly.</p>
                  <p>There is in all ſanctified perſons a new Principle, which alwayes acteth againſt corrupt thoughts, and never complies with them. Vaine impure thoughts will aſſault and break into gracious hearts, but they doe not lodge there; they repell them in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:130756:179"/>
Their coming in they cannot hinder, but their lodging they may and muſt hinder. If thoughts of anger and revenge doe break in upon them, they preſently turne them out of doores.</p>
                  <p>It is the curſed property of prophane perſons, to give lodging to vaine thoughts, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4, 14. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſſe, that thou mayeſt be ſaved, how long ſhall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Hence 'tis evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That they who give lodging to vaine thoughts, were never yet purged from their filthineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the <hi>lodging</hi> of vain thoughts in mens hearts, takes away all hope of ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The firſt work of grace is to purge our hearts from vaine thoughts.</p>
                  <p>What is this lodging of vain thoughts, <label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> we may be ſure that we doe not give lodging to vaine thoughts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 A reſolute ſhutting of the door of our hearts againſt them; when there is a ſincere ſetled purpoſe of heart through the ſtrength of Chriſt, that we will not give way to any wicked wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, though they offer

themſelves, we will not give the leaſt conſent to them; and thereupon we ſet a ſtrong guard at the doore of our hearts to keep out theſe enemies from entring in. Vaine thoughts doe creep into the hearts of ſanctified men by the windowes of the ſoule; ſometimes they break open the <hi>door</hi> upon them through violence of temptation, but they have no free entrance and admiſſion. When we are made willing to open to Chriſt, and entertaine him into our hearts, we preſently caſt out all vaine ungodly thoughts with indignation, and ſhut the doore againſt them for ever: And when our darling thoughts ſhall begin to plead for themſelves, We have been houſhold gueſts, yea, conſtant dwellers with you ſo many years, and yee have often ſolaced your ſelves in us; Oh therefore doe not turne us out without ſome warning, give us a little longer time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not an houre, not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſayes the ſanctified ſoule, yee have lodged here long enough, too long within me, yee ſhall not lodge one moment longer</p>

When vaine prophane thoughts are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed and caſt out, they will ſtrive to re-enter, they will raiſe war againſt our ſoules, to re-gaine their firſt power: We muſt therefore reſiſt them with a ſtedfaſt faith, and repell them with the <hi>Sword of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is a clear evidence that vaine thoughts doe not lodge in us, when their riſing and ſtirring in our hearts is troubleſome and tormenting to us; and the daily diſorder and diſobedience of our thoughts is the matter of our grief and humiliation.

Carnall men can wallow in open notorious offences, without remorſe or inward trouble: whereas ſanctified ſoules doe ſorrow, ſigh, and groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the burden of vaine, irregular thoughts; they are more troubled for a looſe thought, then others are for wicked works.</p>
                  <p>Regenerate perſons doe dayly waſh their hearts from the guilt and filth of vain thoughts.</p>

1 They doe by faith apply the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> for the cleanſing of their conſciences from the <hi>guilt</hi> of their dayly thought-defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. There is nothing that more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth godly men every day to fly to the perfect righteouſneſſe of their <hi>Saviour,</hi> then theſe ſinfull <hi>ſtirrings</hi> of their hearts; when they feele vain thoughts riſing, and find ſomething in themſelves alwayes intiſing them to ſin, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling it ſelfe with their beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They labour by the power of Gods Spirit to purifie their hearts from the <hi>filth</hi> of evill thoughts: They doe not onely ſweep their hearts, but they waſh and thorowly cleanſe them conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 14.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 From thoſe darling thought-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements which ſtick ſo cloſe to our affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From all unprofitable looſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts.</p>

3 From every thought that may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way defile our minds.</p>
                  <p>The hearts of Moraliſts and Formall Profeſſors, are onely ſwept, not waſht; they may ſweep out thoughts of Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſme, Blaſphemy, and ſuch like black and bloody thoughts, but they take no care to waſh their hearts from vain, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and earthly thoughts.</p>
                  <p>So then, 'tis evident that evil thoughts may riſe in the hearts of good men, but they doe not reſt there; they will come in, but they are not welcome; they enter in, but are not entertained; they will break into their hearts, but their hearts are for ever broken off from them.</p>
                  <p>There are two corrupt Fountaines from whence evill thoughts have their originall riſe: That old adverſary <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> from without; and the old man <hi>Sin</hi> within; both which have a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall influence upon the beſt men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Devil delights to ſuggeſt and inject evill into the Saints rather then others; he knowes how torturing and terrifying unholy thoughts are to holy men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 There are in renewed men remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:130756:182"/>
of corruption, which ſends out Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of vaine corrupt thoughts, which war againſt the new man. Now whiles the cauſe remaines, the effect cannot totally ceaſe. So that the pureſt ſouls cannot be free from the riſing of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure thoughts: Yea, multitudes of vaine impertinent thoughts may vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently enter into the hearts of good men, and much diſturb and diſtract them in prayer, and holy performances, by their eruptions, interruptions, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and breakings in; but they doe not lodge in their ſoules, they caſt them out of doores with horror and hatred, as Thieves that come to rob their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>There be three ſpeciall Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that may ſupport the Saints in their continuall conflict and combate againſt evill thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That 'tis not the coming in of vaine thoughts, and their paſſing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the heart, but their <hi>lodging</hi> and <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note> reſting there which is inconſiſtent with ſanctifying grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Evill thoughts riſing up, and breaking into the hearts of the Saints, if they doe not conſent to them,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:130756:183"/>
but abhor and repell them with hatred and humiliation, and faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſhall not be laid to their charge, neither ſhould they hinder their chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comfortable walking.</p>
                  <p>I grant the firſt ſtirrings of evill in the mind, proceeding from within out of our hearts, though not lodged nor allowed of, yet they are our ſins, and muſt be our ſorrowes, becauſe they are the fruits and actings of ſinfull corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions remaining in us: But when we are carefull to cruſh theſe evill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at their firſt riſing, and to confeſſe them to God in our daily prayers, and doe fly to the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for covering, they ſhall not be imputed to us, neither ſhould they interrupt our ſpirituall joy and peace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though evill thoughts may break into the hearts of good men, and often over-power them, yet there is a vaſt difference between the evil thoughts of men regenerate, and men unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: There are three maine Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Evill thoughts in carnall men come from naturall corruption acting in its full ſtrength, vigour and violence. They ſpring from a <hi>ſuperfluity,</hi> or over-flowing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:130756:183"/>
fullneſſe of ſin within them: <note place="margin">James 1. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>As a Fountaine caſts out her waters. ſo a corrupt heart caſts out wickedneſſe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 6. 7.</note> A Fountaine being over-full muſt have a vent: ſo the over-abounding fulneſſe of ſin, which is in the hearts of carnall men, will break out into their thoughts <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. Pſal. 14. 2.</note> continually, filling and defiling all their imaginations.</p>
                  <p>But evill thoughts in renewed men are the iſſuings forth and ſtirrings of corruption, conquered, and crucified, and in a dying condition; this corrupt fountaine dryes up more and more.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Evill thoughts proceeding out of <note place="margin">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Difference.</note> the hearts of carnall men are not reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rejected with deteſtation, but received with delight. But gracious ſoules maintaine a continuall combate, and fight againſt all corrupt thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I grant there may be ſome kind of reſiſtance of wicked thoughts in men unſanctified: But it is</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Either a meer <hi>naturall</hi> reſiſtance, proceeding from naturall conſcience, which abhors and fears ſome kind of black thoughts; as thoughts of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, Atheiſme, Self-murder, and ſuch like; or elſe it is the meer fruit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon grace, and temporary perfections,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:130756:184"/>
ſuch as is found in formall Hypocrites.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is a <hi>particular</hi> reſiſtance: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men may reſiſt ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular thoughts, ſome groſſe notorious thoughts, but they harbour ſundry car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſenſuall thoughts, which they feed upon with delight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Their reſiſtance of ſinfull thoughts is <hi>ſelfiſh</hi> and ſervile, it is becauſe of ſome externall miſery and diſhonourable iſſue whereunto they lead; they know that the ſtrength of wicked thoughts may produce wicked works, and wicked works may produce ſhame and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the world.</p>
                  <p>But in all ſanctified perſons there is a ſtrong, conſtant, ſpirituall, and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reſiſiance of all unſanctified Thoughts</p>

                  <p n="3">3 They fight againſt their ſoules.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Their ſpirituall love to God and his Law, moves them to hate vaine Thoughts, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119. 113.</p>
                  <p>3 Corrupt Thoughts acting in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, add more ſtrength to their <note place="margin">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Difference.</note> corruption, they increaſe the ſtrength and activity of ſin: But evill thoughts riſing in good men, doe tend to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubduing and weakning of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them: The more they feele themſelves aſſaulted by ſinful thoughts, the more they ſeek unto God in the <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> uſe of all holy means for the further mortifying of their ſinfull corruption: They pray more fervently, their cryes and groans are heightned and encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and when they have been overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with vaine thoughts, they double their after-vigilancy.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Sanctifying grace inables and inclines us to that ſpirituall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſervice that God requires in our thoughts; it formeth and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:130756:185"/>

This confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and captivation of the thoughts of our hearts to the Soveraignty and rules of Grace, is of ſpeciall and precious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.

meaſure ſubdue and ſubject our thoughts to Gods will, yet there is ſtill a ſtifneſſe and inflexibility remaining in our minds, ſo far as they are carnall, they are unwilling to bow to the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and they are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt his royall Law, and to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray continually; but when our thoughts begin to ſtray and wander, Grace brings them in againe to the paths of Chriſt, it layes a ſolemn charge upon them, not to wander any more, and bindes them to ſubjection: if ever we will prove our ſelves to be ſavingly ſanctified, it muſt be our chiefe and continuall care to ſerve and glorifie God in our thoughts, as well as in our words and works; <hi>God muſt be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in our hearts, and glorified with our</hi>

                     <hi>ſoules,</hi> by giving up all our thoughts and affections to his will.</p>
                  <p>There is a thought-ſervice that <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> expects and exacts of his people, as well as a tongue-honour, and worke-ſervice: Oh therefore let us labour to render withall reverence and zeale unto the <hi>Father of ſpirits,</hi> a continuall cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thought-ſervice moſt purely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and the rather becauſe it is ſo exceeding pretious and pleaſing to God.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:130756:186"/>
There be foure things that doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and declare the ſurpaſſing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and preciouſneſſe of this thought-worſhip and ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It flowes more immediatly from the <hi>heart,</hi> that that God chiefly deſires, and wherein he principally delights: he calls for our heart as that which carries the whole man with it: thoughts are the free and immediate productions of mans heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No created power can hinder our thoughts from ſerving God and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with him: opportunities, abilities, and means may faile for outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, but the heart is alwayes at leiſure and liberty to think graciouſly and ſpiritually. 1. All the powers of this world, yea all the powers of Hell, cannot hinder a ſanctified heart from an inviſible fellowſhip and fruition of God, with thoughts of ſweeteſt rapture and reverence, of love and lowlieſt adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. They cannot reſtraine it from bathing it ſelfe in that <hi>open fountaine</hi> the precious blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with thoughts of unſpeakable peace joy and triumph. 3. Nor from cloſing and claſping about the pretious promiſes of life, or diving into the unſearchable
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:130756:187"/>
depths of Grace and mercy, with thoughts of faith and higheſt admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 4. They cannot hinder a gracious heart from being as a mountaine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe ſending up a ſpirituall ſacrifice of praiſefull admiring thoughts to the God of mercy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This thought-ſervice is the moſt ſpirituall ſervice, it is ordinarily full of ſpirituallneſſe intention and life, becauſe it is neareſt the object of adoration. The ſtreames which are next the well-head are pureſt and ſtrongeſt; the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and life is in our ſervice, the more precious it is. The beſt men, though they may ſtrive to doe their beſt every way, yet they ſhall finde different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees in their abilities to performe, and in the actuall diſcharge of their duties to God: their works doe not allwayes anſwer exactly to their words; their words cannot fully expreſs the thoughts of their hearts; the thoughts of their hearts come infinitly ſhort in conceiving of the excellency of Gods majeſty, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, might, and glorious perfections.</p>
                  <p>The thoughts of ſanctified ſoules lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold with immediate and neereſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements upon that al-glorious object, the Lord God, and his ſweeteſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:130756:187"/>
give him the glory of his infinite excellencies with more life, heartineſſe, and heavenlineſſe, then their words or actions can doe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A conſtant thought-ſervice is the ſureſt ſigne of heart-ſincerity, <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. That worſhip that is moſt ſpirituall hath moſt truth of heart in it: If mens change in words and works and all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble carriage were <hi>angelicall;</hi> yet if their thoughts were not brought into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Gods will, they were ſtill limbs of Satan. A conſtant ſtriving to ſubject all our thoughts to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the moſt ſound and undeceiving evidence of our uprightneſſe: this inward thought-ſervice being ſecret and inviſible, is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with more certaine ſincerity, and hath a more ſpeciall acceptance with God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Sanctifying Grace <hi>fits</hi> mans heart for divine meditations, and fills it with holy heavenly thoughts; it begets an inward fitneſſe and freeneſſe to entertaine ſanctified thoughts, and brings in fulneſſe of good thoughts; by corrupt nature our mindes have not onely an emptineſs of all holy thoughts, but alſo an unfitneſſe and averſneſſe to take in holy thoughts: carnall men are
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:130756:188"/>
unfit, and unwilling, to ſet themſelves to think of God and divine myſteries, to enter into ſerious thoughts of their ſins, of their laſt end, of the laſt judgement: they have no minde to think what they have done, what they are doing, or what they ſhall doe: they would have <hi>God depart</hi> from their thoughts, and all <note place="margin">Job 21.</note> thoughts of a holy God and his wayes depart from them.</p>
                  <p>But when ſanctifying Grace falls upon us, it implants a freeneſſe and apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in our hearts, ſo far as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, to holy ſpirituall meditations; it brings in heavenly principles which are the ſeeds of heavenly thoughts, and thereby the minde is actuated and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to godly meditations.</p>
                  <p>2. Grace <hi>fills</hi> our hearts with ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied thoughts. Every <hi>good man hath a good Treaſure in his heart:</hi> that is, a <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 35.</note> Treaſure of Grace to ſupply his thoughts, a ſtock of precious Truth to fill and furniſh his thoughts continually. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2.

His <hi>minde</hi> is upon Gods Law and Doctrine by continual medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: he ſpends much time, day and night, in thinking upon the precious precepts and promiſes of God, the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of his word, and the marvellous myſteries manifeſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The thoughts of ſanctified men are of a farre more heavenly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and higher nature, then the largeſt heart of the beſt unregenerate man doth or can poſſibly comprehend: formall profeſſors may have their mindes buſied in the higheſt conſiderations which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, art, morality, or temporary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections can attaine unto; they may ſometimes with joy think upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of life, the happineſs of the Saints, ſalvation that is in Chriſt, the glory of Heaven, and the like; though theſe thoughts never have any roote or long reſidence in their hearts, they quickly glide away; the word of God is not rooted and implanted in their thoughts, they are far from making it their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:130756:189"/>
to <hi>meditate upon the Law of God day and night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thoughts of formall hypocrites doe feed moſt upon the comforts of this preſent world and the ſweetneſſe of their darling ſinne: they have a full taſt and preſent feeling of the pleaſures of their ſweet ſin, and preſent poſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of earthly contentments; but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſound aſſurance by ſaving faith, and univerſality of ſpirituall obedience, of the joyes and glorious things of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and therefore they doe greedily follow and fix upon the preſent things of this life, with conſent of their erring judgement, delight of heart, and moſt of their thoughts: but as for ſpirituall affaires, the glory of God, that <hi>one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing,</hi> the ſtate of their ſoules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things take up the thoughts of hypocrits, but at reverſion, by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and very ſeldome: and when they they come into their hearts, their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment is very cold and ſtrang, their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode ſhort, and while they ſtay they are apprehended and injoyed with much wearineſſe and weakneſſe.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſpeciall prerogative of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified men to have their hearts fill'd with holy meditations: the thoughts
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:130756:189"/>
are never ſo well and welcome to their hearts, as when they are taken up with the deep myſteries of Gods word, and with a holy wiſedome ſtudying how they may exalt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and inlarge his kingdome in themſelves and others. That this is no <hi>idea</hi> or idle abſtraction that I now propoſe, appears pregnantly and plentifully in <hi>Davids</hi> practiſe, who notwithſtanding the ſtrong allurements ordinarily incident to Princes Courts, though the cares and government of a large kingdome laiy upon him, and that he was ſtill followed with troubles and vexations which might much have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed and diſtracted his thoughts, yet the Law of God did ſtill principally take up his thoughts, and that day and night, as himſelfe profeſſeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>Oh how love I thy Law, it is my medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continually.</hi> His thoughts did <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. They think upon the glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:130756:190"/>
of the royall Law becauſe therein Gods holy will is manifeſted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their thoughts doe feed upon the <hi>exceeding great and precious promiſes</hi> of the Goſpel, becauſe in them with ſpecial ſecurity are conveyed to them all the rich treaſures of mercy and forgiveneſs, of ſpiritual joy and peace, light and life, Grace and glory.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They ſpend their choyceſt thoughts upon that rich and royall <hi>pearle</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, their daily thoughts with greateſt joyfulnes and ofteneſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation run after it and ſweetly refreſh themſelves with the glory and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of it.</p>
                  <p>If a poore man upon the way ſhould finde a precious orient pearl, with what greedineſs would his eyes gaze upon it? his exceſſe of joy would eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and confine his ſight to ſuch a rare enriching object, how would his eyes and thoughts be taken therewith? Even ſo after a man by the hand of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith hath laid ſure hold upon the <hi>pearl of great price, Chriſt,</hi> with all his fullneſſe of Grace and glory; the heart is preſently ſo filled with holy affection and admiration, that for ever after it ſpends the moſt, the deareſt, and the

nobleſt thoughts upon this heavenly pearl: and the thoughts once one the winge are ſo cheared raiſed and taken with the ſpirituall beauty thereof, that they follow and fly up with continuall encreaſe of fervency and longing, untill they come unto the clear viſion, and plenary poſſeſſion of it in heavenly glory, and thoſe endleſſe joyes of the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Saints doe ſolace and ſatiate their hearts with thinking on that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing great love and ſuperabundant Grace of God appearing to their ſoules in Jeſus Chriſt: they are never ſo ſweetly ſatisfied, as when they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating upon the excellent beauty of Gods glorious being, his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and immeaſurable greatneſſe, and thoſe bottomleſſe treaſures that are hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They are much in the fore-thoughts of the glorious things to come.

                  </p>
                  <p>But the thoughts of all unregenerate
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:130756:191"/>
men are earthly ſenſuall and ſinfull; they are commonly either rooting in the earth, or drowned in pleaſures, or running after preferment, or ranging up and down idlely &amp; prophanly, or fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly melancholly.</p>
                  <p>Wherein doe the good thoughts of <label type="milestone">

                     </label> ſanctified men mainly differ from the good thoughts of formall profeſſors and all kinde of unſanctified ones?</p>
                  <p>It is evident that unſound profeſſors <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> may have good thoughts ſometimes, as well as good affections, and ſpeeches, which proceed from the thoughts; they may have thoughts materially good, but not ſpiritually good.</p>
                  <p>Men may begin to have better thoughts of the Saints, and of the holy path then formerly; &amp; worſe thoughts of themſelves and their own wayes, yea thoughts againſt their old wayes; yet there is a vaſt difference between the good thoughts of renewed men, and of the beſt kinde of unrenewed men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They differ in the principle from whence they riſe. The good thoughts of formall hypocrits proceed either from outward principles, as</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the convincing power of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:130756:191"/>
Gods word which may fall upon them with that conviction and terrour, that it may ſomewhat alter their thoughts and affections, and produce thoughts of humiliation, of reforming their ways <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their thoughts may <hi>taſt of the good word,</hi> though they cannot feed upon it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From the ſtrength of afflictions, which may worke in them thoughts of <hi>ſeeking</hi> God, and <hi>returning</hi> to him.</p>

The good thoughts of formaliſts and temporaries proceed from principles of <hi>nature</hi> improved aſſiſted and raiſed by the addition of common gifts and graces <note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> of the holy ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>But the good thoughts of ſanctified men proceed from a new living princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple implanted in their hearts from the holy <hi>Law put into their minds.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Good thoughts doe not lodge with any ſetled abode in the hearts of hypocrites; they paſſe as ſtrangers through their mindes, they are as a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to them. If their thoughts doe ſometimes glance upon divine objects, they are quickly off againe; good thoughts in ſuch men doe ſpend their
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:130756:192"/>
life in their birth, as they ariſe, ſo they glide and paſſe away without any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fruit or profit to their owne ſoules.</p>
                  <p>But holy thoughts in holy men have their conſtant abode, they are their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe and delight; the word of God dwels in their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Sanctifying grace ſettles, faſtens and keeps the minde upon good thoughts: there is a ſtrange unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and unſetledneſſe in our hearts ſo far as they are fleſhly: when they have taken in and entertained good thoughts, yet they will not be long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on them, unleſſe they be fixed and eſtabliſhed by an Act of Grace. There is the greateſt reaſon that divine ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things ſhould attract and draw out the attention and intention of our mindes. God is a moſt glorious ſoule-ſatisfying object, the thoughts of whoſe excellencies ſhould ſwallow up all other thoughts: yet we may finde by ſad experience that our minds are apt to be moſt unſteady in our thoughts of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our thoughts are apt to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and unſetled in all Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: As</p>
                  <p n="1">

1 In prayer, when all earthly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent thoughts ſhould ſtand furtheſt off, yet how often doe they creep in, and carry away our mindes from God, and from attending the preſent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 When we are hearing Gods word how unfixed are our thoughts? how often doe they run out to worldly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutable objects? But ſo far as renewing Grace prevailes and poſſeſſeth our hearts, it healeth and mortifies this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſſe, and keeps our thoughts cloſe to divine objects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Grace puts us upon the carefull and conſtant uſe of all holy means and helps for the ſetling and fixing of our thoughts upon good things.</p>
                  <p>What means muſt we uſe to fix and <label type="milestone">

                     </label> faſten our minds to holy and profitable meditations?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Cry unto the God of all Grace, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> for ſtrengthning ſtabliſhing Grace: let us confeſſe and bewaile our thought-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteadineſſe, and entreat God to fix our thoughts on heavenly things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In our dayly meditations let us preſent variety of good objects to our thoughts, that ſo our mindes may walke from truth to truth, from promiſe to
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:130756:193"/>
promiſe, from one precious object to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Variety of freſh objects doe much refreſh the minde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt carefully guard our outward ſenſes, that they wander not after vanities: our eyes and eares are often the occaſions of our thought-wandrings.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Sanctifying Grace ſets up a holy <hi>Regiment</hi> in our thoughts and imaginations, it ſets bounds to them, and implants a heavenly wiſedome to rule and over-rule them: this is the peculiar prerogative of ſanctified me and ſpeciall character of ſincerehearts For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They alone doe hate and abhor idle looſe wandring thoughts, of which formall profeſſors either take no notice at all, or not much to heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Regenerate men doe eſtabliſh (as it were) a gracious Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt their thoughts, to keep out confuſion, diſorder, looſneſſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: they ſet bounds and limits to the multitudes of thoughts and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations that daily ariſe: they labour to keep them within the compaſſe of divine rules by erecting a holy order of rule and Government amongſt them:
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:130756:193"/>
They confine their Thoughts to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent and feeling meditation upon Gods word and works; to a care of conſcionable managing the affaires of their calling.</p>
                  <p>Onely ſometimes, but ſparingly, with many Cautions, exceptions, and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſſe, they let them out to honeſt Recreation.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever Thought is wandring without this compaſſe, or within it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere and ſelfiſh, is ſinfull and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant. If the Saints take any Thought ſtragling without theſe limits, or any inticers to vanities and impertinencies, any obtruders and diſturbers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order and peace of their Thoughts, they preſently apprehend them by the vigilant eye of their ſpirituall wiſdome; they examine them by the Law of God, and condemn them in the Court of an enlightned conſcience, and ſo cut them off in time by the power of Grace, and the <hi>ſword of the ſpirit,</hi> by repelling and cruſhing them at their firſt riſing in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Many flatter themſelves from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of an <hi>impoſſibility of ruling</hi> their Thoughts and imaginations, and are ready to lay all upon naturall weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:130756:194"/>
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They think it impoſſible to order and over-power their Thoughts, being ſo divers in kind, ſudden in their motion, and ſo innumerable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch muſt know, That if we be truly ſanctified, we have a new light, life, and might from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby we are inabled to doe all that God Commands, <hi>evangelically.</hi> Sanctified perſons have</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Such a <hi>light</hi> as diſcovers not onely dunghills, but <hi>motes</hi> themſelves, even the leaſt flying imaginations, and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth their ſoules for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They have a new Divine ſtrength whereby they are able by degrees to ſubdue and ſubject their Thoughts to Gods will: And if vain looſe Thoughts preſſe in upon them (as they are as buſie as little Flies in ſummer) yet they will not lodge them, but they caſt them out with hatred and horrour.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Sanctifying Grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants ability and aptneſſe in the mind to gather and extract holy profitable Thoughts out of all objects that are preſented to it from all things that we ſee or hear. We are by nature barren and empty of heavenly Thoughts; but

Grace coming in doth ſpiritualize our minds, &amp; the mind ſo far as it is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpiritualizeth all objects, ordinary oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, &amp; occurencies, turning them into heavenly, ſpirituall Thoughts, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Meditations.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 We ſhould fix our firſt thoughts every day upon that great and glorious end for which we have our life and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and how every thing we doe, and that befalls us, may be reduced, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and made ſerviceable to this high

end, <hi>Gods glory.</hi> The ſetting of our thoughts in a holy order every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will much conduce to the right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of our thoughts; it will prevent and keep out thoſe earthly ſenſuall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which doe attend at the door of our hearts to make the firſt entry, and to take up our thoughts for all the day.

                     <p>It is a thing much to be lamented and laid to heart, that Chriſtians who profeſſe themſelves Heires of Heaven, having matters of that weight and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to exerciſe their hearts upon, ſhould ſpend their thoughts upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, vanity, and <hi>nothing,</hi> as all earthly things will ere long appear.

'Tis impoſſible for idle men and women to be free from idle, fooliſh, and filthy thoughts. An idle life is a burden to it ſelfe, and it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens mans mind with abundance of vain ungodly thoughts.
