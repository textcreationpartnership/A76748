            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The fir≈øt and great work of the <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> in the conver≈øion of ≈øinners by the Mini≈øtery of the Go≈øpel is upon their thoughts. Here are four expre≈ø≈øions in

the text that doe mainly and primarily hold forth the thoughts: the≈øe <hi>≈øtrong holds</hi> and <hi>heights</hi> are chiefly in mens thoughts. If once the thoughts be ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ≈øanctified, and ≈øet in frame, the affections, and all the actings of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible conver≈øation will be in a holy hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly order of obedience.</p>
                  <p>In handling this doctrine of the <hi>thoughts,</hi> there are three <hi>my≈øteries</hi> which I will endeavour to open. 1. The <hi>my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>iniquity,</hi> which worketh in mans thoughts before renewing. 2. The <hi>my≈øtery</hi> of <hi>≈øanctity,</hi> which acteth in mans thoughts after the renewing of the heart: both the≈øe are held forth in this Text.</p>
                  <p>3. The my≈øtery of <hi>Satanicall injected</hi> thoughts wherewith the Saints are much <hi>buffeted:</hi> the≈øe black bla≈øphemous thoughts are as ≈øo many Darts which Satan<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> ca≈øteth into the holie≈øt hearts: many precious ≈øoules walke ≈øadly and ≈øorrowfully, not being acquainted with the ri≈øe of the≈øe wicked thoughts, and the grounds of ≈øupport that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture di≈øcovers.</p>

                  <p>But what Law of God did the≈øe men violate in their thoughts?

thoughts and workes. Actions come from powers, and are ≈øuitable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; holy ≈øpirituall Acts cannot come from un≈øanctified powers and faculties; living thoughts cannot proceed out of dead mindes.</p>

                  <p>All our holy thoughts and works are the fruits and actings of this divine life in us: there mu≈øt be a power and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of holine≈øs put into mans heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can think holy thoughts: every thing acteth according to its being: <hi>an evill tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> Carnall mindes cannot thing ≈øpirituall thoughts.</p>
                  <p>The≈øe things being premi≈øed I now come to the Doctrine it ≈øelfe; in the
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:130756:172"/>
opening whereof, I mu≈øt</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, demon≈øtrate that renewing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting Grace doth primarily and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally put forth it ≈øelfe upon mans thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I will declare what are the powerfull, precious, operations of ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace upon the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Fir≈øt, that ≈øanctifying Grace, after the change of the frame of our hearts, doth fir≈øt and chiefly worke upon our thoughts; I thus demon≈øtrate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Evill thoughts are the radicall ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall ≈øinnes which corrupt our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, affections, and all our actions; therfore it is nece≈ø≈øary that our thoughts ≈øhould be fir≈øt clean≈øed cured and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by Grace.</p>
                  <p>Sinne entred into our fir≈øt parents by their thoughts; crooked thoughts were the root of their cur≈øed apo≈øtacy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All our actuall ≈øinns have their beginning and ri≈øe in our thoughts: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill thoughts are the <hi>begetters</hi> of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øinnes, the fir≈øt <hi>movers</hi> and <hi>leaders</hi> in all evill, the <hi>plotters</hi> of all iniquity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God and man; Till the≈øe radical evills be rooted up, our words and works will be the fruits of ≈øin: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after the crucifying of the habituall
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:130756:172"/>
corruption of mens nature, the principal work of Grace is to mortifie and purifie their thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that the fir≈øt Act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and mortification pre≈ø≈øed upon ≈øinners, is to <hi>wa≈øh their hearts from wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedne≈ø≈øe;</hi> that is, <hi>from vaine thoughts</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 4. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>which lodge within them:</hi> True repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance begins whence ≈øin begins; that is, in the thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>≈øtrong hold</hi> whereby the Devill holds po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of mens ≈øoules, is chiefly in their thoughts; Till the thoughts be ca≈øt down and changed by converting Grace, the Devil cannot <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4, 5.</note> be ca≈øtout.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all <hi>actuall holine≈ø≈øe</hi> begins in the thoughts; habituall holine≈ø≈øe is properly in the new frame of our hearts; actual holine≈ø≈øe is that which is acted in our affections and conver≈øations: holy works and words have their ri≈øe from holy thoughts: as the ≈øpirits are in the body, ≈øo are thoughts in the ≈øoule, they run through all, move all, and Act all in us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the new ≈øpirituall <hi>minde</hi> is put for the whole <hi>new man,</hi> for all that is regenerate in us, in our mindes, wills, affections, and all the powers of

and to put them upon the profe≈ø≈øion of piety, outward performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and joyning to Churches: Mens words and works may be ≈øeemingly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hone≈øt and honourable, who≈øe thoughts are ba≈øe, prophane, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>

If we would take certain knowledge of our ≈øelves, whether we are good or evill men, ≈øanctified or un≈øanctified, we mu≈øt looke into the frame of our thoughts. Every man is compared to a <hi>Tree,</hi> our thoughts are the mo≈øt di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing fruits whereby we may di≈øcern what manner of Trees we are. The onely way for other men to know what kind of Trees we are, is by our vi≈øible fruits, externall works and ≈øpeeches: But if we our ≈øelves would judge of our ≈øelves, we mu≈øt try our ≈øelves fir≈øt and chiefly by our internall thoughts. The ≈øure≈øt and mo≈øt infallible way to judge of our ≈øpirituall e≈øtate, is by the con≈øtant acting of our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>2 Thoughts and imaginations doe ordinarily follow the frame and temper of the heart wherein they are formed, and ≈øo they are the true≈øt di≈øcovery of the nature and con≈øtitution of the heart: As ≈øtreams doe re≈øemble and expre≈ø≈øe the quality and property of tho≈øe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines whence they ≈øpring. We may truly judge of the frame and fabrick of our hearts, by the ordinary working of our thoughts.</p>
                  <p>But now we are not to take mea≈øure of our thoughts by ≈øome particular ≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:130756:175"/>
and extraordinary motions we ≈øometimes feele in them; but according to the common current and generall actings of our thoughts; For ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times evill men may have good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and workings in their thoughts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that which is good; but good thoughts in carnall men doe glide and pa≈ø≈øe away pre≈øently without any fruit to their owne ≈øoules.</p>
                  <p>So on the other ≈øide, good men may ≈øometimes be over-powred and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by evill thoughts, either by the ≈øudden breaking out of remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption from within, or by violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va≈øion of ≈øome enti≈øing object from without; or by the impetuous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate injections of <hi>Satan:</hi> But ≈øuch thoughts as the≈øe are contrary to the generall and ≈øetled purpo≈øe of their hearts.</p>

Thirdly, The whole conver≈øation followes the frame and temper of the thoughts: Such as a mans heart is, ≈øuch are his thoughts ordinarily; and ≈øuch as his thoughts are, ≈øuch is the frame of his conver≈øation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7. <hi>As a man tbinketh in his heart, ≈øo is he.</hi> The thoughts of men are the ≈øpring from whence i≈ø≈øues a good or bad conver≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are the ma≈øter-wheele which acteth &amp; turnes about the whole cour≈øe <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> and carriage of their lives; they have a ≈øtrong influence upon all their wayes.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øweetning of this <hi>≈øpring</hi> ≈øweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the whole conver≈øation: If wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be corrupt, the fountaine mu≈øt fir≈øt be clean≈øed and ≈øweetned, and then the ≈øtreames will be ≈øweet. The Prophet <hi>healed the waters by ca≈øting ≈øalt into the ≈øpring,</hi> 2 Kings 2. 20.

Carnall men doe feed upon the forth of their filthy thoughts with delight, but regenerate men doe with much bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of ≈øpirit judge them≈øelves for their thought-tran≈øgre≈ø≈øions; yea, many humble ≈øoules, ≈øen≈øible of their ≈øecret provocations, are more grieved and troubled (≈øetting a≈øide the ill of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:130756:177"/>
and ≈øcandall, ordinary attendants upon open and vi≈øible mi≈øcartiages) for the rebelliou≈øne≈ø≈øe of their thoughts, then the exorbitancy and iniquity of their works: It wounds them to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart that they are not as well able to pre≈øerve their inward thoughts pure and holy towards the all-≈øearching eye of God, as their words and vi≈øible acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons plau≈øible and orderly towards men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Sanctifying Grace begets a ≈øincere and deadly <hi>Hatred</hi> of all evill thoughts. <hi>P≈øal.</hi> 119. 113. Sayes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, I hate vaine thoughts.</hi> Renewed per≈øons doe not onely di≈ølike evill thoughts, but they al≈øo hate them, as the grand Enemies of God, they de≈øire to have them crucified.</p>
                  <p>2 They hate not only tho≈øe thoughts which are mo≈øt black and bloody, but vaine thoughts al≈øo; they hate all wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and unprofitable thoughts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Renewing Grace <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> the thoughts, and puts them into a holy frame: The naturall frame of mans heart is evill, therefore all that it frameth is altogether evill. A corrupt <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> fountaine cannot ≈øend forth pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but ≈øanctifying grace coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mans heart, implants a new holy
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:130756:177"/>
principle, which is the ≈øpring of holy li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoughts; it makes the mind rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy &amp; prepared to every good thought. A ≈øanctified heart is full of ≈øanctified thoughts, it is continually exerci≈øed in godly, u≈øefull, and profitable medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It can have no re≈øt but in ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conver≈øes with God. Grace co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from heaven, doth carry up the thoughts into heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Sanctifying Grace <hi>Purifies</hi> the thoughts, it mortifies that Lording power which ≈øin exerci≈øeth in mens thoughts before their renewing. The hearts of all men in their corrupt frame are as a boyling <hi>Sea,</hi> or as a <hi>Sepulchre</hi> of corruption, evapourating and ≈øending up continually wicked, wanton, and prophane thoughts.</p>
                  <p>How doth grace clean≈øe and cure our <label type="milestone">

                     </label> thoughts, the <hi>fle≈øh,</hi> or corruption of mans nature, that <hi>root of bitterne≈ø≈øe</hi> which embitters and corrupts our thoughts continually. Grace <hi>purifies</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Acts 15. Mark 7. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>our hearts,</hi> which are the fountaine out of which our thoughts doe flow; this fountain mu≈øt be clean≈øed, and ≈øweetned

before our thoughts can be clean: Can any clean thing come forth of that which is unclean?</p>
                  <p>That ≈øinfull corruption which reigns <note place="margin">Job 14. 5.</note> and rages in the hearts of naturall men, mu≈øt be crucified before the ≈øtrength of ≈øin can be broken in their thoughts. If carnall men by the power of the word ≈øhould be ≈øo affrighted and terrified from the committing of that ≈øin which they mo≈øt love, that they dur≈øt never actually returne again to it; yet then their naturall corruption would fill their hearts with ≈øpeculative unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, and thought-pollutions; their thoughts would ≈øtill be running after ≈øin. When the worldly <hi>man dyes, his thoughts peri≈øh;</hi> ≈øo when <hi>the old man</hi> is mortified in us, evill thoughts dye, in re≈øpect of their predominant power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Grace purifies our thoughts by filling the mind with the pure and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious word of God, which is a powerfull means to keep out and ca≈øt out evill thoughts <hi>I have hid thy word in my heart</hi> (in my thoughts, ≈øayes <hi>David) that I might not ≈øin again≈øt thee,</hi> P≈øal. 119. 11.

                  <p>When we feele thoughts of unbelief, pride, di≈øobedience, earthline≈ø≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> begin to ≈øtir in us, and to offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, let us try them by the word of Chri≈øt, ≈øee how contrary they are to it, and we ≈øhall feele them vani≈øh away, they will not ≈øtand to a Tryall.

We feele idle, vaine, loo≈øe, earthly, impure, and impertinent thoughts ri≈øing in our hearts continually; they a≈ø≈øault and break in upon us whatever we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oftentimes they lead us captive:

Oh therefore how can we conclude that we are truly ≈øanctified, when we feele ≈øuch ≈øwarmes of un≈øanctified thoughts?</p>

                  <p>2 But grace mortifies ≈øin in re≈øpect of that overpowering prevailing opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it once had in us, while we were under ≈øin: So that grace doth not ≈øo take away evill thoughts that they cea≈øe to ri≈øe and ≈øtirre in us; but it ca≈øts them downe from their command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power and prevalency, they doe not work with that impetus ≈øtrength and efficacy as formerly.</p>
                  <p>There is in all ≈øanctified per≈øons a new Principle, which alwayes acteth again≈øt corrupt thoughts, and never complies with them. Vaine impure thoughts will a≈ø≈øault and break into gracious hearts, but they doe not lodge there; they repell them in the very en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:130756:179"/>
Their coming in they cannot hinder, but their lodging they may and mu≈øt hinder. If thoughts of anger and revenge doe break in upon them, they pre≈øently turne them out of doores.</p>
                  <p>It is the cur≈øed property of prophane per≈øons, to give lodging to vaine thoughts, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 4, 14. <hi>Oh Jeru≈øalem, wa≈øh thine heart from wickedne≈ø≈øe, that thou maye≈øt be ≈øaved, how long ≈øhall thy vaine thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Hence 'tis evident,</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Though evill thoughts may break into the hearts of good men, and often over-power them, yet there is a va≈øt difference between the evil thoughts of men regenerate, and men unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: There are three maine Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
